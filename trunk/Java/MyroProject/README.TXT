PROJECT TITLE: Myro-Java

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project includes the Myro classes needed to interface with the Scribbler/Fluke
robot.

VERSION or DATE: 1.0

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:

AUTHORS: Douglas Harms, DePauw University (dharms@depauw.edu)

USER INSTRUCTIONS:  This class/project is provided for two reasons:
1) It allows a user to instantiate a Scribbler object on the workbench and experiment with the methods.
2) It allows a programmer to examine the source code if s/he wants to see it.

Package Myro is usually access via the Myro.jar file in application programs, so this source code package
is not necessary.
