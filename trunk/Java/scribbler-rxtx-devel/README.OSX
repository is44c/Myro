Building rxtxScribbler on MacOSX:

./configure
make

Then move the following files:

  RXTXScribblerComm.jar to /Library/Java/Extensions
  (apple-darwin)librxtxScribblerSerial.jnilib to /Library/Java/Extensions

NOTE: You may need to have the developer version of JDK installed.  If ./configure has problems
finding the HEADERS folder you may have to edit Makefile (instructions will be printed by
./configure script).  Or the following command may be helpful:

sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/

(See https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NAR-177 for a description. )
