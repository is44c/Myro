This repository contains files for the Java implementation of the Myro API.
Specifically:

INSTALL.txt: Instructions for installing Myro-Java.

Binaries: the binary libraries and .jar files required by Myro-Java.  Installation
instructions are included in the various system sub directories.

JInput-Test: A BlueJ project for testing communication with the gamepad

Project: a BlueJ project that contains the Myro-Java code as well as a few simple
test applications.

scribbler-rxtx-devel and scribler-rxtx-bins: Source code and binaries for the
scribbler-adapted rxtx library, used for communication with the scribbler/fluke.
The files in these directories are not required (hopefully!) to install myro-Java,
but are included here for information purposes only.
