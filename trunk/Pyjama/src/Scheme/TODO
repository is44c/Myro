Scheme Differences

1. Improper lists are currently implemented in a hackish manner. 
   Need to fix parser, and then adjust application to work with
   real dotted-pairs.

2. No continuations, and no call/cc

3. Currently not properly tail recursive

4. Some number types are missing: bignum, complex, scientific

5. (= 1/1 0) segfaults


Things to do

1. Figure out how to call graphics static fields

2. Write serial port in c# and consume in Scheme
