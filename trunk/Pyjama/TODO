1. Menu Hook up items:
   a. undo/redo - do no undo before load
   b. accelerators for items (eg, control+s)
   c. search

2. Make backup copy prior to each save (filename~). Good idea to have
   automatic backup, and recover, before actual save

3. Add dialog on close/exit for unsaved items

4. Fixed width font for Python?

5. Is there a way to handle text/plain? Currently uses text/html

6. Check for read-only, and other problems on open
   a. Warn on trying to open binary file
   b. Prevent opening same twice

7. Keep track of the last directory on open and reuse on next open

8. Add close boxes in tab

9. Editable config
   a. font, size, indent
   b. search path

10. Make the shell be based on mime_type: Ruby for .ry, 
    Python for .py, Bash for C#, etc. Could make a set of tabs
    so that you could be editing a mixture of languages...

11. Print

12. Logging items for later analysis

13. In Pyjama/python/*.py I took out coding lines

python/getopt.py:# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-
python/inspect.py:# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-
python/shlex.py:# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-
python/tarfile.py:# -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*-

What needs to be added to pyjama.exe to prevent that?
