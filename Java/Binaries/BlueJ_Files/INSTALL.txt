INSTALL

The files in this folder contain definitions for Myro/Java templates for use in the BlueJ
environment.  These are not necessary per-se, but will be helpful for students using 
"Learning Computing with Robots-Java Edition" textbook.

Installation:

1) Copy the files in folder newclass to (bluej_dir)/lib/english/templates/newclass

2) Edit file (bluej_dir)/lib/bluej.defs to include extendScribbler and scribblerMain in
the definition of bluej.classTemplates.  (Alternatively, have each student edit their own
bluej.properties file.)

For example, this definition might look like:

	bluej.classTemplates = extendScribbler scribblerMain stdclass

3) Edit file (bluej_dir)/lib/bluej.defs to include the following in the definition of 
doctool.options:

	-tag pre:cm:Precondition: -tag post:cm:Postcondition:

For example, the definition might look like:

	doctool.options=-author -version -nodeprecated -package -tag pre:cm:Precondition:  -tag post:cm:Postcondition:

(Alternatively, have each student edit their own bluej.properties file.)

4) Edit file (bluej_dir)/lib/bluej.defs and change "-paackage" to "-public" in the definition of
doctool.options.  (See the example in step 3.)  This will cause protected fields of Myro/Java classes
to be hidden should students open the Documentation view of Myro/Java classes.

5) Copy folder Sandbox to a location in each student's class folder (i.e., where they will save
all class work).
