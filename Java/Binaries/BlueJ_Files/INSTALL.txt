INSTALL

The files in this folder contain definitions for Myro/Java templates for use in the BlueJ
environment.  These are not necessary per-se, but will be helpful for students using 
"Learning Computing with Robots-Java Edition" textbook.

Installation:

1) Copy the files in folder newclass to (bluej_dir)/lib/english/templates/newclass

2) Edit file (bluej_dir)/lib/bluej.defs to include extendScribbler and scribblerMain in
the definition of bluej.classTemplates.  (Alternatively, have each student edit their own
bluej.proerties file.)

For example, this definition might look like:

	bluej.classTemplates = extendScribbler scribblerMain stdclass

3) Copy folder Sandbox to a location in each student's class folder (i.e., where they will save
all class work).
