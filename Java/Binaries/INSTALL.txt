The Binaries folder contains all files needed to install Myro/Java in your system.  Two types
of files are necessary - jar files that are common to all platforms, and drivers specific for
each platform.

The jar files are contained in the JAR_FILES folder, and INSTALL.txt contains installation
instructions.

All platform-specific drivers are contained in a single folder with an appropriate name
(e.g., folder Win-32 contains drivers specific for 32 bit Windows systems).  Each of these
folders has an INSTALL.txt file with instructions.
