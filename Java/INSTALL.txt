Installing Myro-Java

1) Install JDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
   MacOSX Note: JDK is on the System Installation Disc, under dev tools.  The
   package is XCode.

   Linux Note: on Linux systems openjdk is often installed, but this doesn't play
   nicely with BlueJ, so installing Sun's JDK is necessary.


2) Install BlueJ (http://www.bluej.org)
   Note: On Linux systems be sure to select Sun's JDK, not openJDK, during BlueJ
   installation.
   
3) Copy the .jar files and library files based on your system.  These files, 
   along with instructions, are contained in the Binaries folder.
