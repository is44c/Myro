    - win32all (if on windows)


Python/Scribbler
 
 - Interacts with the scribbler robot from Python. The python script
   polls the scribbler for its sensor values and sets the motor and
   speaker parameters.

    - demos.py

 - Additional Packages

 - Instructions

    - Install scribbler_server.bs2 on the robot 
    - Make sure PySerial (and win32all if on windows) is installed
    - Run one of the demos in demos.py

 - Issues
   
    - Scribbler automatically echoes packets so right now we echo
      packets *twice*. This can be fixed but I wanted to make sure why
      the packets where being echoed automatically first.  My
      suspicion is that its due to the pins being normally used for
      programming.

    - The bluetooth adapter changes which COM port often (e.g. after
      reboot) so you have to keep track and change the adapter in the
      python script.


 - Troubleshooting

    - Make sure the baud rates are the same in the python script, the
      basic program, and the bluetooth adapter if you are using that.

    - Make sure the AT commands are disabled when you use the
      bluetooth adapter with the scribbler.

    - Make sure the bluetooth passkey is correct
